# Phase 7 — Analysis Ledger, Comparison, and Report Export

## Status

Phase 7 adds dataset-scoped immutable analysis history to the consolidated Analysis Workspace. It does not change solver execution, `AnalysisSession.v1`, `WorkspaceState`, or the certified solver-result contract.

## Canonical flow

```text
Completed / failed AnalysisSession.v1
→ AnalysisLedgerController
→ AnalysisLedger.v1
→ active entry / comparison pair
→ AnalysisReport.v1
→ deterministic JSON / CSV / Markdown artifact
→ explicit browser download
```

## Ownership boundaries

### `AnalysisSessionStore`

Owns one active reviewed session and its input lifecycle:

- draft
- ready
- running
- completed
- failed

Closing or replacing the active session does not own or delete historical evidence.

### `AnalysisLedgerStore`

Owns immutable terminal evidence for the active dataset:

- deterministic ledger entry sequence
- archived completed and failed session snapshots
- active result designation
- optional left/right comparison selection
- dataset-scoped lifecycle

The ledger never invokes a solver and never mutates a session.

### `AnalysisLedgerController`

Owns EventBus orchestration for:

- terminal-session archival
- dataset reset
- active-entry selection
- comparison selection/reset
- history clearing
- report construction
- explicit export and download

### Properties panel

The Properties panel remains presentation-only. It publishes validated ledger commands and renders ledger snapshots. It does not import the ledger store, report builder, export serializer, or solver implementation.

## Contracts

### `analysis-ledger/v1`

```text
schema
├── datasetId
├── entries[]
├── activeEntryId
├── comparison
│   ├── leftEntryId
│   └── rightEntryId
└── version
```

### `analysis-ledger-entry/v1`

Each entry contains:

- deterministic `entryId`
- deterministic sequence
- archive key derived from `sessionId + requestId`
- dataset identity
- the complete deeply immutable terminal `AnalysisSession.v1`

Duplicate completion or failure notifications cannot create duplicate entries.

### `analysis-ledger-comparison/v1`

Comparison is allowed only when entries:

- are distinct;
- belong to the same dataset;
- use the same analysis capability.

The comparison flattens bounded engineering evidence into stable paths and classifies every row as:

- `equal`
- `changed`
- `left-only`
- `right-only`

Compared domains include:

- target and capability identity
- inspected input evidence
- reviewed overrides
- readiness
- result status, summary, values, warnings, diagnostics, and metadata
- failure evidence

### `analysis-report/v1`

Report mode is either:

- `single` — the selected active ledger entry;
- `comparison` — a complete compatible left/right pair.

The report preserves dataset, entry, session, request, target, capability, workspace-version, session-version, input, override, result, and failure traceability.

### `analysis-export-artifact/v1`

Supported formats:

- JSON
- CSV
- Markdown

Artifacts contain:

- stable filename
- MIME type
- UTF-8 content
- deterministic byte length
- source report ID

No dates, timestamps, randomness, or environment-dependent identifiers are written.

## Lifecycle rules

History is preserved when:

- the selected entity changes;
- the active reviewed session is closed;
- another reviewed session is opened;
- an entry is designated active;
- comparison is reset.

History is cleared when:

- a new dataset is loaded;
- the dataset is cleared;
- the user explicitly clears history;
- the workspace is destroyed.

Explicit history clearing retains the current dataset identity. Dataset clearing removes it.

## Event contracts

```text
analysis:ledgerChanged
analysis:ledgerActiveRequested
analysis:ledgerComparisonRequested
analysis:ledgerComparisonResetRequested
analysis:ledgerClearRequested
analysis:ledgerFailed
analysis:exportRequested
analysis:exportCompleted
analysis:exportFailed
```

All write operations are command events. `analysis:ledgerChanged` is the canonical immutable state notification.

## Guardrails

- No solver execution from the ledger.
- No imported-dataset or normalized-entity mutation.
- No active-session mutation during archival.
- No duplicate archival for the same session request.
- No timestamp or random identifiers.
- No automatic exports.
- No report-tab restoration.
- No React or Zustand inside `src/workspace`.
- No runtime module over 300 lines.

## Certification

Phase 7 certification covers:

1. deterministic terminal archival;
2. duplicate-event idempotency;
3. deep immutability;
4. active-result selection;
5. compatible comparison and stable row classification;
6. single and comparison report validation;
7. byte-stable JSON, CSV, and Markdown output;
8. explicit browser download behavior;
9. session-close and selection preservation;
10. dataset and teardown reset boundaries;
11. listener disposal;
12. all prior workspace, engineering, benchmark, release, and production-build gates.

## Non-goals

Phase 7 does not provide:

- persistent server or browser storage across reloads;
- signatures or issue approval workflow;
- PDF generation;
- spreadsheet generation;
- report templates;
- model editing;
- additional engineering calculators.
